Flask App for Deepfake creation demos and educational material 

Our team's central purpose was to use Flask as a backend framework to write an educational 
website that would allow users to view facial swap video elements produced by images and video 
clips that are team had already synthesized using blending techniques. Additionally, we wanted to use 
Flask to facilitate various user-friendly pages with educational information regarding the 
proliferation of deepfakes, some common use cases, and potentially ways of detecting differences 
in information between actual images and deepfaked ones. We also include material about the Collective 
Resilience Lab's prior work and general mission. 

The running of our website requires Python-Flask dependencies to be installed, for which we recommend 
the use of a virtual environment. Dependencies relating to imported Flask elements vary, as we 
worked with some Flask functionalities which are now considered outdated.
